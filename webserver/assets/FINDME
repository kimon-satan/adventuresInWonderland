You’re very late indeed … but at least you found me. 

Oh I’m being rude , I should introduce myself. I’m Rabbit. 

This is Underland. It’s a dark world of shell scripts, makefiles, header files and more. I will help you on your adventure through it. So far you have learnt some really useful bash commands …

“cd” + directory path - change directory
“ls” - list the files in a directory
“ls -a” - list all the files in a directory including hidden files
“ls -l” - list all the files in a directory in long format
“ls -F” - list all the files and put a slash after each item which is a directory  
“pwd” - print the file path of the current directory
“less” + filename - read the contents of a file in the less editor

You might want to cut and paste this list for reference. Why not use simple text to make a new file and build up a list of commands and tips as you go. 

Now it’s time to go further into Underland. Do you see the theLittleDoor ? Good - go inside, explore and see if you can work out what to do.
