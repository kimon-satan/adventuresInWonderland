Hi,

You are about to embark on a little adventure. My aim is that by the time you reach its end you will have mastered some invaluable command line tools.

The adventure follows a twisted path, but it shouldn't take too long to complete. You will be challenged at times, but it also has some fun surprises in store.

Remember, do not be distraught when things get tough. It simply means that you are about to learn something new. Be patient and meticulous when watching tutorials - embrace the complexity !

Your first task is to find Rabbit. He is hiding somewhere down that rabbit hole in a file. Look inside the directory rabbitHole using Finder or Windows Explorer. It looks empty, but Rabbit has cunningly hidden all the files in the rabbit hole by prefixing them with a dot. This means you can’t see them in the usual way. You will have to explore the rabbit hole using the command line.

Watch this video to learn about using the command line and navigating through files and folders. Use “cd” to enter different directories. Use “ls” with various options to explore directories and find hidden files. Use “less” to read files. Use “pwd” to see what directory you are in. Keep moving down the rabbit hole until you find what you are looking for - you’ll know it when you see it.

PS. When I refer to commands I will always put them in quotation marks. You should always ignore the outermost quotes.
