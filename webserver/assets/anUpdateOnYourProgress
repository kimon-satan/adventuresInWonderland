You just slipped through the little door but you’re too big to get out again. You’re stuck !

Not to worry I can help you. in this directory you’ll find a file called DRINKME.sh.

This is a shell script.

Watch this video on running shell scripts and then run DRINKME.sh to continue.

PS. Make sure you are connected to the internet or the script will not work properly
